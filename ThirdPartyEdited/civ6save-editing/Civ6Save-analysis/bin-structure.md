### Section 2: Player Blocks

Notes:
* The number of teams equals the number of players plus the number of city-states plus 2 (1 for barbarians and 1 for free-cities)
* This section repeats one time for each team
* The player is always the first team listed
* Though not confirmed, the order of teams if probably civs then city-states then free-cities then barbs (those last two might be switched)
