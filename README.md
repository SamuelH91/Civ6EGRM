## How to
1) Start civ game
1) Start file copier (or use your own method to collect saves)
    - Set correct path to 'runFileWatcher.py' with your text editor
      - 'watchDir = os.path.expanduser("~/Documents/My Games/Sid Meier's Civilization VI/Saves/Multi/auto/")'
      - Set Multi or Single (and/or (Epic) if you don't play it via Steam)
    - Open cmd
    - 'python runFileWatcher.py'
    - Check within 10 turns that saves are going to target directory ('./data/auto/<AUTOGENERATEDFOLDER>')
    - NOT VALID ANYMORE: Remember to (re)move old autosaves from './data/auto' to somewhere else (especially if you want to continue later)
1) Stop it when you have done playing the game
    - You can continue it later, just check that './data/auto/<AUTOGENERATEDFOLDER>/' has correct files
1) Run end game replay map code
    - check that './data/auto' has correct files
    - 'python endGameReplay.py'    (runs by default files from ./data/auto) or use runEndGameReplay.bat
    - 'python endGameReplay.py -d <someDirectoryWithAutoSaves>'    (to change directory)
    - or run by double clicking 'autoRunEndGameReplayHere.bat' from './data/auto/<AUTOGENERATEDFOLDER>/'
    - Save your game as gif or mp4 (with custom fps) (endGameReplayMap.gif/mp4)
    - Share it with your friends

Any feedback or suggestions are appreciated.

## Update
1) Use git
1) or run nonGitUpdater.py (which downloads necessary files from GitHub)

## Localization
Localization is done automatically by
- 'python parseLocalization.py' but you have to set correct paths inside the code (if you have some new DLCs)
- vanillapath = os.path.expanduser("G:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Sid Meier's Civilization VI\Base\Assets\Text")
- dlcpath = os.path.expanduser("G:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Sid Meier's Civilization VI\DLC")

## TODOs
- Include natural wonders and other tile improvement data (some custom visualization?)

- Nice to have stuff in future:
  - Optional visualize units
  - Show disasters (e.g. meteors would be quite easy from tile data)

## Troubleshoot
If following error at the start of endGameReplay.py file
"qt.qpa.plugin: Could not find the Qt platform plugin "windows" in ""
This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem."
Set following entry to your system environment variable (at least one confirmed case in windows 7)
QT_PLUGIN_PATH  C:\Python38\Lib\site-packages\PyQt5\Qt\plugins  (change the path according to your installation location)

To get emoji symbols working somehow on Windows install Segoe UI Emoji Regular font (seguiemj.ttf) (from Windows 10 but Windows 7 can't show those colored)
